 ### <font color=coral> Promblems </font>
**1.Lag**
For example,when uesr click a function named "invasion" something unpleasant happend,the application will seize for seconds,not a long time but not a good thing,i think as a programer.
**2.UI**
The application now is version 4.1 ,the UI is much more beautiful than previous versions.But,I think it can be more exciting with  the help of WPF.These days I'm studying WPF and gain some wonderful knowledgeas and ideas .
**3.Chaotic**  **Code**
Maybe  for users, an application with chaotic code inside cant make them unpleasant.But for me,a developer can be very awful.Chaotic code means you must spend more time to modify code.Expecially when you want to add some more exciting functions in app.

 *<font size=5> Solution for the chaotic codes.</font>*
Yesterday I check all of the codes and package some essential codes to functions.This means I can use these functions reaptly to carry out specific function what I want. It also makes code clean and tidy.
- *<font size=5> UI and Lag</font>*
This two problems,actually I have noidea how to solve them.But what excites me is that when I uploaded my app to Baidu forum,I met some guys whose coding ability is more than me.They are all very friendly and will to help me to solve these probelms.

### End
As a primary programer,there are always some wonderful ideas in my mind.But what a pity,I dont konw how to make them come ture.Fortunately this is the age of Internet,there are plenty of forums and post bars so that you can explore these forums to find a solution for your problem.Also some friendly programer would like to give there help to you. So I believe ,after a while I can make ideas come true and becaom a junior programer
